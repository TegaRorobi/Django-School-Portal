The user model should have the following fields:
- name 
	I'll use a separate field  instead of the default first_name and last_name fields 
- email : 
	This will be used as the identification for users, apart from the passkey, 
	so this has to be unique for all users. I'll use the default 'email' field.
- passkey:
	This is an auto generated string that the user would use to login to their account
	the credentials for this passkey would be handed to the user, as account creation
	would be handled by the school's technical dept.
- is_student and is_educator:
	Boolean flags as to whether the user account is for a student or a teacher.

For the custom user backend I created, the backend checks for the email and 
the auto generated passkey as the credentials before logging in a user. Admin accounts
can alternatively use their password to login or the auto generated passkey.

Because the username field is required in django authentication, I'll give it an outward
name of email and add an email validator. And i'll also remove the default email field
from the required fields.
